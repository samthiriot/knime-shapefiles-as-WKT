## knime-shapefiles-as-WKT

This collection of nodes for the [KNIME scientific workflow engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KNIME)
offer to manipulate [shapefiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapefile) in KNIME. 
Geometries are decoded and manipulated as their [Well-Known Text representation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_text_representation_of_geometry) (WKT), which are stored as native KNIME Strings. 

The collection offers nodes to read shapefiles as KNIME data tables and store KNIME data tables as shapefiles.
