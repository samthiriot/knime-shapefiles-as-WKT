    <name>View WKT Spatial Data</name>
    
    <shortDescription>
        View spatial data encoded as WKT on a map.
    </shortDescription>
    
    <fullDescription>
        <intro>
        Displays one (or two) table(s) made of spatial features on a map.
        <p>
        Input data should contain a "the_geom" column encoded in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_text_representation_of_geometry">WKT (Well-known Text)</a> representation,
        and a variable storing the Coordinate Reference System. 
        The best is to display data which was loaded using the "Read Shapefile as WKT" node.
        </p>
        <p>
        Once you are in the the view:
        <ul>
        <li>wheel scrolling zooms in and out</li>
        <li>the "Spatial tools" menu provides "zoom to fit", zoom in and out, info or pan (move) features</li>
        </ul> 
        </p>
        <p>
        You can color the geometries by tuning the default colors in the configuration pane. 
        You also can use the color manager node, and assign colors to each line based on its
        characteristics; this leads to more interesting symbologies.
        </p>
        <p>
        The actual visualization is done using the wonderful <a href="https://geotools.org/">geotools library</a>.

        <option name="top table: default color">
        The color to use if there is no color assigned to each line
        </option>

        <option name="top table: opacity">
        Opacity of the geometries of the first table. Keeping a bit of transparency is good (defaults to 0.7), as it helps to 
        detect overlapping geometries.  
        </option>

		<option name="bottom table: default color">
        The color to use if there is no color assigned to each line
        </option>

        <option name="bottom table: opacity">
        Opacity of the geometries of the first table. Keeping a bit of transparency is good (defaults to 0.5), as it helps to 
        detect overlapping geometries, and enables to views the geometries of the first table below.
        </option>
        
        <option name="WMS server for overlay">
        The server to load the background overlay from. Change in case the overlay is not displayed.
